ps :

two strings can be combined if one is a subsequence of the other. 
  subsequence = we can delete some character (without reordering) to get smaller string.

  how to recognise pattern

Keywords : sequence , remove characters without changing order . this is two pointer 
  traverse both string
  try to match characters of the smaller string inside the large one
  if you reach end of smaller string its a subsequence


  why not dp ? check only subsequence existence not longest subsequence length.

bool isSubsequence(const string &a, const string &b) { 
  int i = 0, j = 0; 
  while (i < a.size() && j < b.size()) {
    if (a[i] == b[j]){
      i++; 
  }
    j++;
  } 
  return i == a.size(); 
}

main(){
  if (isSubsequence(s1, s2) || isSubsequence(s2, s1)) 
    cout << "YES\n";
  else cout << "NO\n";
}
}
