# ps:
villagers (student) = queue , meals (sandwich) = stack
  each step compare front villg preference with the top meal
  if match both removed else villg rotates to back 
  STOP : when front vlg keep refusing and none else need the top meal.
  O/p : vlgs left.


=> brute : simulate queue rotation until stuck, work for small n , but inefficient for n is large. 
int bhooke_villagers_naive(vector<int>& villgers, vector<int>& meal) {
    queue<int> q;
    for (int v : villgers) q.push(v);

    int idx = 0; // index for meals stack (top = 0th element)
    int rotations = 0; // count how many consecutive rotations without eating

    while (!q.empty() && idx < meal.size()) {
        if (q.front() == meal[idx]) {
            // villager eats the meal
            q.pop();
            idx++;
            rotations = 0; // reset rotations since someone ate
        } else {
            // villager moves to back
            q.push(q.front());
            q.pop();
            rotations++;

            // if we've rotated through all villagers without anyone eating → stop
            if (rotations == q.size()) break;
        }
    }

    return q.size(); // villagers left unable to eat
}


  

=> better : o(n) and o(1) . count vlgs prefer 0 and 1 , traverse meal stack from top to bottom , for each meal . if vlg of that type exit , decremenet the cnt  , else stop immediately.

  📌 DSA Pattern & Topic
Pattern: Queue + Stack simulation → but optimized via Counting / Greedy.

Topic: Greedy + Hashing (frequency counts).

Recognition keywords:

“Queue rotates until stuck” → simulation.

“Stop when no one wants the top item” → frequency check.

“Villagers vs meals, both binary (0/1)” → counting suffices.
