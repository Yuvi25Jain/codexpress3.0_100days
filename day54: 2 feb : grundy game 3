    Badminton Shuttle Game
    -----------------------
    Lakshya Sen vs Kidambi Srikanth

    Rules:
    - Two reserves: Reserve 1 (X shuttlecocks), Reserve 2 (Y shuttlecocks).
    - Lakshya starts.
    - Lakshya's moves: (1,1) or (2,0).
    - Kidambi's moves: (1,1) or (0,2).
    - Player who cannot move loses.

    Logic:
    - Kidambi wins if:
        * X == 0 (Lakshya cannot move)
        * X == 1 and Y >= 2 (Lakshya forced into losing move)
        * X == Y and X is even (equal even piles are losing for Lakshya)
    - Otherwise, Lakshya wins.

    Complexity:
    - O(T) for T test cases.
    - Handles constraints up to 1e9 easily.

        // Losing positions for Lakshya
        if (X == 0 || (X == 1 && Y >= 2) || (X == Y && X % 2 == 0)) {
            cout << "Kidambi\n";
        } else {
            cout << "Lakshya\n";
        }

    return 0;
