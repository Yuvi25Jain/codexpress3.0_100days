#ps :
we have n passengers in a queue . 
  each can buy 1 ticket per second
  if they still need more tck then then they go to end of line
  if they are done they can leave
  output : compute total time until passenger at position k finish buying their tckt.

  approach :
  queue simulation is slow so 

  i <=k : before or at k  , they can buy at most ticket[k] before k finish, 
i > k : we stp once k finish , others can buy tick[k]-1 


code : 
int time_to_by_tck(vector<int>& tck , int k){
  int time = 0 ;
  int n = tck.size();
  for(int i = 0 ; i<n ; i++){
    if(i<=k){
      time += min(tck[i], tck[k]);
    }
    else{
      time += min(tck[i], tck[k]-1);
    }
  }
  retunr time;
}

Tickets = [2, 3, 2], k = 2
tickets[k] = 2

i=0 → min(2, 2) = 2

i=1 → min(3, 2) = 2

i=2 → min(2, 2) = 2
Total = 6 ✅
