question : there are given n blocks given , and two players are playing the who who picks the last block will win . also a player can pick 1,2,3 max block in its turn

note / oobservation from dry run of test cases that the n = 4 is always the loosing position for us. : solution 


  #include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  
    int T;
    cin >> T;
    while (T--) {
        long long n;
        cin >> n;
        if (n % 4 == 0) cout << "No\n";
        else cout << "Yes\n";
    }
    return 0;
}
