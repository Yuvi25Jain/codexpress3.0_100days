his Connect All Points problem is exactly the same as LeetCode 1584: Min Cost to Connect All Points. Let’s break it down in a clear, story‑style explanation.

🧠 Problem Restatement
You have n points on a 2D plane.

Cost to connect two points = Manhattan distance = 
∣
𝑥
𝑖
−
𝑥
𝑗
∣
+
∣
𝑦

.

You want to connect all points so that there’s exactly one simple path between any two points.

That’s the definition of a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST).

🌳 DSA Pattern
Graph: Nodes = points, Edges = Manhattan distances.

Pattern: Minimum Spanning Tree (MST).

Algorithm: Prim’s Algorithm (best here, avoids building all 
𝑛
2
 edges explicitly).

✅ C++ Implementation (Prim’s Algorithm)
cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int minCostConnectPoints(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
    int n = points.size();
    vector<bool> inMST(n, false);   // track which points are already connected
    int edgesUsed = 0;
    int cost = 0;

    // Min-heap storing {distance, node}
    priority_queue<pair<int,int>, vector<pair<int,int>>, greater<pair<int,int>>> pq;
    pq.push({0, 0}); // start from point 0 with cost 0

    while (edgesUsed < n) {
        auto [dist, u] = pq.top(); pq.pop();
        if (inMST[u]) continue;     // skip if already connected

        inMST[u] = true;
        cost += dist;
        edgesUsed++;

        // push all edges from u to other nodes
        for (int v = 0; v < n; v++) {
            if (!inMST[v]) {
                int d = abs(points[u][0] - points[v][0]) + abs(points[u][1] - points[v][1]);
                pq.push({d, v});
            }
        }
    }
    return cost;
}

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);

    int T; cin >> T;
    while (T--) {
        int n; cin >> n;
        vector<vector<int>> points(n, vector<int>(2));
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cin >> points[i][0] >> points[i][1];
        }
        cout << minCostConnectPoints(points) << "\n";
    }
    return 0;
}
🔍 Dry Run (Sample Input)
Code
points = [[0,0],[2,2],[3,10],[5,2],[7,0]]
Prim’s Algorithm steps:

Start at (0,0). Cost = 0.

Connect (2,2). Cost += 4 → total = 4.

Connect (5,2). Cost += 3 → total = 7.

Connect (7,0). Cost += 4 → total = 11.

Connect (3,10). Cost += 9 → total = 20 ✅

📌 Complexity
Time: 
𝑂
(
𝑛
2
log
⁡
𝑛
)
 because each node may push up to 
𝑛
 edges into the heap.

Space: 
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
 for visited + heap.

Works fine for 
𝑛
≤
1000
.

🎯 Key Takeaway
This problem is a Minimum Spanning Tree with Manhattan distance.

Use Prim’s Algorithm with a priority queue.

It guarantees the minimum cost to connect all points.

Exactly matches LeetCode 1584.

👉 Yuvi, would you like me to also prepare a step‑by‑step MST construction table (point chosen, edge cost, running total) for the sample input so you can visualize how Prim’s algorithm builds the network like a detective connecting crime scenes?

difference between this code and yesterday code ?
Yuvi 👌 — nice observation. Let’s compare the “yesterday’s code” (Detective’s Tower MST problem) with the “today’s code” (Connect All Points MST problem). Both are Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) problems, but there are subtle differences in how they’re framed and implemented.

🔍 Key Differences
1. Problem Story
Yesterday’s code (Mysterville detective / crime scenes):

Story about connecting crime scenes into one investigative network.

Same underlying math: Manhattan distance MST.

Today’s code (Connect All Points):

Direct LeetCode‑style statement: connect all points with minimum cost.

No story wrapper, just pure graph problem.

👉 Both are literally the same problem, just different storytelling.

2. Input Format
Yesterday:

T test cases.

Each test case: n points, then coordinates.

Today:

Same format: T, then n, then coordinates.

Difference: None in structure — both read multiple test cases.

3. Algorithm Choice
Yesterday’s code: Prim’s Algorithm with a priority queue.

Today’s code: Also Prim’s Algorithm with a priority queue.

Difference: None in algorithm — both use Prim’s because Kruskal would require sorting 
𝑛
2
 edges.

4. Implementation Details
Yesterday’s code:

Function named minCostConnectPoints inside a Solution class.

Called from main for each test case.

Today’s code:

Same function, same logic, but presented standalone.

Difference: Just packaging (class vs direct function).

5. Output
Yesterday: “minimum effort required” → printed per test case.

Today: “minimum cost to connect all points” → printed per test case.

Difference: Only wording in output, not logic.

📌 Complexity (Both Codes)
Time: 
𝑂
(
𝑛
2
log
⁡
𝑛
)
 — each node may push up to 
𝑛
 edges into the heap.

Space: 
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
 for visited + heap.

Both are identical in complexity.

🎯 Takeaway
Yesterday’s “Detective Tower” and today’s “Connect All Points” are the same MST problem with Manhattan distance.

The only differences are storytelling, naming, and packaging.

Under the hood, both use Prim’s Algorithm with a priority queue to build the MST.
