pairing problem : we can process two items per step it they're different categories , otherwise only one.
  optimal strategy to pair as much as possible until one cateogry dominates.


similar to :  leetcode 2335 : minimum amt of time to fill cups

important formula : sum+1/2 , why 2 ? bcuz we are taking 2 or pair at a time , if only sum then we need extra second where sum is odd... so best 
  is this, (BALANCED)

what if one of those dominates (10 medium , 0 slow , 0 fast) we can't pair them , we must charge them one by one. that;s why we also need maxval 
  (largest pile)


  Problem statement :

three types of charges : fast , slow , medium 
  each second : we can charge two vehicles of different types OR we can charge one vehicle of any type. 
    given = amt(3) means slows , fast , medium

output : find minimum number of seconds to charge all vehicles.

Input 1: [1,4,2] (BALANCED)
sum = 7
maxVal = 4
(sum+1)/2 = 4
max(4,4) = 4 → ✅ matches sample output.

Input 2: [0,0,5] (DOMINATE FAST)
sum = 5
maxVal = 5
(sum+1)/2 = 3
max(5,3) = 5 → must charge one by one → ✅ correct.

  
CODE: 
int fillCups(vector<int>& amount) {
        int sum = amount[0] + amount[1] + amount[2];
        int maxval = max({amount[0], amount[1], amount[2]});  
        int ans = max(maxval, (sum + 1) / 2);
        return ans;
    }
