#ps :
n friend sit in circle
  start at friend 1
  pass the pillow k time(counting starting friend)
  the kth friend is eliminated
  next round start immediately clockwise of eliminate friend
  continue until one remain which is winner


  Optimal approach: Josephus Recurrence
      Recurrence relation : J(1,k) = 0 
        J(n,k) = (J(n-1,k)+k) mod n

  output final winner = J(n,k)+1 (convert to 1 index)

  code :
int josephus(int n, int k) { 
  int res = 0; // base case J(1, k) = 0 
  for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) { 
    res = (res + k) % i;
  } 
  return res + 1; // convert to 1-indexed
}


tc : o(n) , sc = o(1)

  🧠 Circular Queue vs Josephus Problem
Circular Queue:

A data structure where elements are stored in a fixed‑size array.

Front and rear pointers wrap around when they reach the end.

Operations: enqueue, dequeue, peek.

Goal: manage data efficiently in a circular buffer.

Josephus Problem:

A mathematical elimination process in a circle.

Every k‑th person is removed, and counting continues from the next.

It’s not about managing a queue efficiently, but about finding the survivor’s position.

The circle is a logical model, not a data structure requirement.

🚀 Why They Feel Similar
Both involve a circular structure (wrap‑around behavior).

Both can be simulated using a queue (rotate until elimination).

That’s why the brute force solution often uses a circular queue or vector erase.

📌 Key Difference
Circular queue is about storage and access.

Josephus problem is about elimination pattern and survivor position.

The optimized Josephus solution doesn’t need a queue at all — just modular arithmetic.

✅ Analogy
Think of it like this:

Circular queue = a train platform where passengers board and leave in a cycle.

Josephus problem = a game where every k‑th passenger is eliminated until one remains.

Same circular motion, but different purpose.


Theory : Josephus Problem : theoratical problem in maths and cs . model circular elimination game. 
  finding the safe position in a circle when every kth person is eliminated.
